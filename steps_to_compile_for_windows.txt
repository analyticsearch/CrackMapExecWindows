I. Set up the compilation environment
	python-2.7.10.msi
	[Git-2.6.1-32-bit.exe] (https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.6.1.windows.1/Git-2.6.1-32-bit.exe) to clone the impacket repo
	crackmapexec prerequisities with pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
	VCForPython27.msi to be able to compile the pyinstaller core module
	pyinstaller with pip install pyinstaller

II. Monkey-Patch the original code General rules to ensure Windows compatibility:
	Remove references to Unix stuff like os.geteuid(), that don't make sense on Windows
	Patch the code section related to term colors from

	from termcolor import cprint, colored
	to
	from termcolor import cprint, colored
	import colorama
	colorama.init()

	Take a look at the following link for more information on that topic.

	3. Remove illegal chars in created/accessed filenames

III. Compile pyinstaller --clean --onefile crackmapexec.py

IV. Profit Find the around-6MB executable in the created dist folder
